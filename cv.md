## About me:

**I'm looking for remote job or internship opportunities with the potential for career growth and advancement.**

In 2020, I earned a master's degree in the area of ​​'Innovative Technologies in Human Resource Management.'
My education allowed me to accumulate 7 years of experience working for a large international company and in the Nizhny Novgorod Region government.
While serving as a team leader and chief specialist, I've developed skills like attentiveness, critical thinking, decision-making, result orientation,
communication, stress resilience, continuous self-improvement, and more.
